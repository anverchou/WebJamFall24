# WebJamFall24

So currently, what we have:
For the landing page/main page
    - index.html
    - scripts.js
    - styles.css

For each of the game page
    - sample.html
(currently i do numbers, cuz ig it's the simplest, but we can do other themes later like programming language, musics, cake, harry potter, games, animes, tarot lol)
    - game.js
    - game.css

To run the code or see what we are having, just open the html on browser

Some ideas to implement from most priority to least
    - count number of moves (i believe we can store this locally)
    - ask the user if they want to have a limit for number of moves
    - level (one game played, rank up)
    - accessible (sounds, alternative text)
    - multiplayer

LOWKEY I think we can spice it up by gamifying it (even though it is already a game JAJLKDJ)
    - each time the user check in, they can redeem a certain amount of game credit (eg 1000)
    - each move they play, it will deduct a certain amount (eg 10)
    - if they got it right, they get 100, if they got it wrong, deduct 50
    - when they finish a theme, they will get 500
    
    and we can say something like if they got to a certain thing, they can unlock/redeem something else idk
    - if we do it like this way, i think it's still a good idea to have more like interesting sounds
        for fun: if we do league, we can embed the champions' lines lmaooo
        for accessibility: which would be a good thing to include in portfolio/resume

i think we dont need a database for this cuz we can just store the credit locally
but ig this would make this at least more joyful
